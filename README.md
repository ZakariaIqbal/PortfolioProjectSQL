📊 **Covid-19 Data Exploration: Unveiling Insights Through SQL**

In the pursuit of understanding the global impact of Covid-19, I embarked on a data exploration journey, leveraging SQL to glean insights from raw data. Let's dive into some key findings and methodologies employed:

🔍 **Skills Utilized:**
- Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temporary Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Creating Views
- Data Type Conversion

💡 **Key Insights:**
1. **Total Cases vs Total Deaths:** Analyzed the likelihood of fatality upon contracting Covid-19 in various countries.
2. **Total Cases vs Population:** Revealed the percentage of population affected by Covid-19 across different regions.
3. **Highest Infection Rates:** Identified countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
4. **Highest Death Counts per Population:** Highlighted countries with the highest death counts adjusted for population size.
5. **Continental Analysis:** Explored death counts per population at a continental level.

🌍 **Global Perspective:**
- Investigated global trends in new cases, total cases, total deaths, and death percentages over time.
- Examined the correlation between total population and vaccination efforts worldwide.

📈 **Data Visualization Preparation:**
- Utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables to structure and analyze data efficiently.
- Created a view to store processed data for future visualization and analysis.

This project underscores the power of SQL in uncovering actionable insights from complex datasets, contributing to informed decision-making in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.
